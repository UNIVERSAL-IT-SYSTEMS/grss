My TODO list:

1. A local copy of PORTDIR should be created in CONST.TMPDIR + GRS name.  This is
to prevent wierdness in case /usr/portage changes during a run.

2. Upon building a system we should make use of the binpkgs in CONST.TMPDIR + GRS name
as a time saver.  This is something to go into the build scripts in the GRS repo and not
in the GRS suite.

3. Fix log rotation which adds extra empy "seeds" which it rotates before using!
