My TODO list:

1. A local copy of PORTDIR should be created in CONST.TMPDIR + GRS name.  This is
to prevent wierdness in case /usr/portage changes during a run.

2. Upon building a system we should make use of the binpkgs in CONST.TMPDIR + GRS name
as a time saver.  This is something to go into the build scripts in the GRS repo and not
in the GRS suite.

3. grsup and clean-worldconf should remove files form /etc/portage that correspond to
sections that were removed from world.conf since the last time grsup or install-worldconf
was run.  Currently, if a section is removed from world.conf on the remote repo, then any
files in canonical form in /etc/portage are orphaned.  This can lead to trouble because
the the flags they define are not removed.  This needs to be fixed in clean() in grs/WorldConf.py.
